This Spring Boot app `game-tracker` creates an in-memory h2 database, initialized with a few games I (have) playe(d).
It also exposes a simple RESTful API that allows you to perform CRUD operations on these games.

It serves as a base for a playground to test @ControllerAdvice, @WebMvcTest, and @DataJPATest.
